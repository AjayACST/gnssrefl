### Niwot Ridge, Colorado

Station nwot was originally installed by Kristine Larson, Eric Small, Ethan Gutmann, 
and Felipe Nievinski at the University of Colorado. The site was hosted by the Niwot 
Ridge LTER.  After the receiver failed, a new receiver
was installed by Mark Raleigh (then at CIRES, now at Oregon). No one has visited the site
to download the data since spring 2020.

The data are available from UNAVCO

Because it was installed to support GPS reflections, it has always tracked L2C.
Although data are available in the files, the antenna does not support L5.

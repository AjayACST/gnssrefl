### Lake Superior

Station mchn is operated by NRCAN. The data are archived at SOPAC. Don't tell Fox News, but 
this site is in Canada.

[Use my web app to get a sense of what the site looks like.](https://gnss-reflections.org/fancy6?example=mchn)
You are provided with a photograph, a google earth map, and a sample periodogram output.  Look 
at them please!

**Coordinates:**
You can try the [Nevada Reno site](http://geodesy.unr.edu/NGLStationPages/stations/MCHN.sta).
The coordinates do not have to be super precise (within 100 meters is fine)

Unfortunately only L1 data are of any use at this site. Encourage the station operators to 
track L2C! (and Galileo, Glonass, and Beidou for that matter.)

# 2023 SHORT COURSE: GNSS INTERFEROMETRIC REFLECTOMETRY

### Basic principles and an introduction to the gnssrefl software 
**Proposed Dates:** May 1-4, 2023 

**Times:** 9-11 am Colorado Daylight Time

**Venue:** This course will be offered virtually

***

**The goals for this short course are to:**

- introduce participants to the basic principles of the GNSS-IR method
- provide support for users installing and running gnssrefl (python, PyPi, Jupyter notebooks, Docker images, introduce use cases)
- demonstrate and discuss gnssrefl use in practical sessions on snow accumulation, soil moisture and water levels.
- provide guidance on GNSS-IR site location selection, low-cost sensors and contributing to open-source scientific software. 

**Participants successfully completing this short course will:**

- understand the accuracy/precision and strengths/weaknesses of the GNSS-IR technique
- be able to use the gnssrefl software.
- understand what factors make for a good GNSS-IR site 
- know how to contribute to open-science software.

## Expectations
Our data show that people who participate in all the activities and allot time to working 
on the exercises independently learn a lot and gain confidence. Those who do not fully participate often become frustrated and fall behind. We expect participants to:
* Make sure the gnssrefl code has been installed and is working properly prior to the class.
* Complete the assigned gnssrefl homeworks; based on your background, watch the suggested online videos.
* Bring results and questions to the live sessions.

## Computer Requisite and Operating Systems:
We provide dockers, pypi builds, and the python source code on github. PC users will only be 
able to run the software via dockers. Linux and OSX users can use any of these choices.
Jupyter Notebook users will need to install the docker.

We have designed this short course to be an active learning exercise. 
Participants are expected to complete the assigned homework before the 
online course lectures begin. 

In the weeks before the live class is offered, 
EarthScope staff will help participants set up and install Jupyter notebooks, python, and/or docker images.

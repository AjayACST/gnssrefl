# 2023 SHORT COURSE: GNSS INTERFEROMETRIC REFLECTOMETRY

### Basic Principles and an Introduction to the gnssrefl Software Package
**Dates:** May 1-4, 2023 

**Times:** 9-11 am CDT?

**Venue:** This course will be offered virtually

***

**The goals for this short course are to:**
1. introduce participants to the basic principles of the GNSS-IR method
2. provide support for users installing and running gnssrefl (python, PyPi, Jupyter notebooks, Docker images, introduce use cases)
3. demonstrate and discuss gnssrefl use in practical sessions on snow accumulation, soil moisture and water levels.
4. provide guidance on gnss-ir site location selection, low-cost sensors and contributing to open-source scientific software. 

**Participants successfully completing this short course will:**
1. understand the accuracy/precision and strengths/weaknesses of the GNSS-IR technique
2. be able to measure snow accumulation and water levels using data from the global GNSS network. 
Participants are encouraged to analyze their own GNSS data.
3. understand what factors make for a good gnss-ir site and how to contribute to open-science software.

## Expectations
Our data show that people who participate in all the activities and allot time to working on the exercises independently learn a lot and gain confidence. Those who do not fully participate often become frustrated and fall behind. We expect participants to:
* Make sure the gnssrefl code has been installed and is working properly prior to the class.
* Complete the assigned gnssrefl homeworks; based on your background, watch the suggested online videos.
* Bring results and questions to the live sessions.

## Computer Requisite and Operating Systems:
Participants are expected to have their own computers which should be running linux or OSX.
Motivated Windows users have successfully [run the docker images](https://gnssrefl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/docker_cl_instructions.html#for-windows-users); the instructors are not able to offer guidance on this other than the existing readme.

We have designed this short course to be an active learning exercise. Participants are expected to complete the assigned homework before the online course lectures begin. In the first session of the class, EarthScope staff will help participants set up and learn how to use Jupyter notebooks, python, and/or docker images.

## How you can help improve this code

- Archives frequently change their file transfer protocols. If you find one 
in <code>gnssrefl</code> that doesn't work anymore,
please fix it and let us know. Please test that it works for both older and newer data.

- If you would like to add an archive, please do so. Use the existing code as a starting point. 

- Check the [issues section](https://github.com/kristinemlarson/gnssrefl/issues) of the repository and look for "help wanted."

- Write up a new [use case](https://gnssrefl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/first_drivethru.html)

- Investigate surface related biases.

## How to get help with your gnssrefl questions

If you are new to the software, you should consider watching the 
[videos about GNSS-IR](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9KIPkLxL-c_d-NlNsaoGgScWqSxxUB5n)

Before you ask for help - you should check to see if you are running the current software.
Please go to the install page for help on how to update your latest 
docker/jupyter installs. For github/pypi, we recommend doing a clean download and new install.

You are encouraged to submit your concerns as an issue to 
the [github repository](https://github.com/kristinemlarson/gnssrefl). If you are unfamiliar 
with github, you can also email Kelly (enloe@earthscope.org ) about Jupyter 
NoteBooks or Tim (dittmann@earthscope.org) for commandline/docker issues. Please include

* the exact command or section of code you were running that prompted your question.

* details such as the error message or behavior you are getting. 
Please copy and paste (this is preferred over a screenshot) the error string. 
If the string is long - please post the error string in a thread response to your question.

* the operating system of your computer.

Would you like to join our <code>gnssrefl</code> users email list?
This is currently operated by earthscope.org. To join, please send Kristine an email.

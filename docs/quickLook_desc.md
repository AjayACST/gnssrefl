### Description of Quick Look Analysis

The four subplots show the GNSS-IR analysis from the different regions surrounding the GNSS 
antenna (northwest, northeast, southwest, southeast). 

Within each plot, each color represents the results of a frequency analysis for 
a different satellite arc. The periodogram has been computed so that the x-axis 
is the reflector height (RH, in meters) and the y-axis is the spectral amplitude
in converted SNR units (volts/volts).  If you see a strong peak in the periodogram,
that means you will have a good estimate of the RH for that satellite arc. The data
represented in gray are "failed" periodograms.
